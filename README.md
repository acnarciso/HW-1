Homework 1
================

You are currently in the GitHub repository (repo) for `HW-1`. You must have completed all the steps in [Setting Up](https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH216/jekyll/update/2016/09/12/getting-started.html).

Learning Goals
--------------

-   Getting experience manipulating real, messy, and complex data via the `dplyr` package
-   Familiarizing yourself with R Markdown, a tool for reproducible research. If your `.Rmd` file won't knit, take a look at the [debugging sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/edit).
-   For those of you new to involved programming/coding, learning that [Google](https://xkcd.com/627/) is your best friend.

Homework
--------

1.  Answer the individual questions in `HW-1.Rmd`.
2.  Once you're finished, submit `HW-1.Rmd` following the same steps as in <a

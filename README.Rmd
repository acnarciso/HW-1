You are currently in the GitHub repository (repo) for `HW-1`. You must have
completed all the steps in [Setting 
Up](https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH216/jekyll/update/2016/09/12/getting-started.html).



## Learning Goals

* Getting experience manipulating real, messy, complex data
* Familiarizing yourself with R Markdown, a tool for reproducible research.

* For those of you new to involved programming/coding, learning that
[Google](https://xkcd.com/627/) is your best friend.
